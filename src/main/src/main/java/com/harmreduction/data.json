        "-Body": "<p>There are many different printing technologies. While it might be clear to the asker that he's talking about his home 3D printing machine, that's not necessarily the case for those that try to answer the question.</p><p>I think it would help to specify the scope of questions with tags, to allow future visitors to identify what type of 3D printer it is about. Answers to a lot of questions related to general properties of the printing process like printing speed, resolution, additional manual work, support structures, etc. depend heavily on the technology that's being used.</p><p>This also prevents \"Well, it depends...\" type of answers that cover a lot of possibly unrelated things.</p>",
